How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helped because rather than having to read the whole file I only had to read a small portion of it

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can easily see any changes that you have made and then revert to them if need be.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manually saving means that your save points will be more logical and easier to understand. Autosaving can mean that your saves will be in the middle of a line. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
For something like Git it is useful as the multiple files will all be interconnected, whereas for Google Docs where the files are probably not connected it would be a waste of time to save a version of a file that hasn't changed. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows you all of the different commits you have done, git diff shows you what has changed between two different versions. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Not much more considering something like android studio seems to do a lot of this anyway. I hope this becomes more useful for me.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use git so that I can have a better understanding of the next android course that I want to take.
