When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you were sharing your work with other people, other people were working on your code, or you are woking on it in multiple places.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I don't know, maybe if you have some changes that you have made that you don't want to erase or something like that?
