What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Not much, you get a new .git file. It doesn't commit anything, it just kind of turns the folder into a repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
teh staging area is kind of where you put things before you have fully decided what you want to commit, so it is where you say which files you want to commit, I think.s
