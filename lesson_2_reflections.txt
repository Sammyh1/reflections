What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Not much, you get a new .git file. It doesn't commit anything, it just kind of turns the folder into a repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is kind of where you put things before you have fully decided what you want to commit, so it is where you say which files you want to commit, I think.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
If you have two separate changes in two separate files then you can add one of them to the staging area and then commit that, and then you would add the next one to the staging area and then commit that.
